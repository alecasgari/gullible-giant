## Project Overview

This project involved the creation of an intelligent multi-step migration form for Rahkar Gasht, an immigration agency. The form collects detailed user input such as name, gender, work experience, language proficiency, education level, income, and number of children. After submission, a smart video is shown to the user, which serves as an engaging personalized interaction.

## Challenges and Solutions

* The form is designed to be multi-step and dynamic to accommodate a detailed data collection process without overwhelming the user.
* Integration of N8N automation workflows to process data entered by users and generate a customized paragraph suggesting suitable migration destinations based on the answers.
* Implementation of a secure OTP system using one-time codes generated and validated through N8N, disseminated to users via SMS and WhatsApp.
* Storage of OTP codes and user data within Google Sheets, acting as a lightweight database for workflow validation.
* Real-time notifications and lead management were integrated with the client’s CRM system (Payamgostar) via HTTP request modules, ensuring data synchronization.
* Slack notifications were configured for admins to monitor the lead generation process efficiently.
* Final lead information and UTM parameters were broadcasted to a Telegram group for team-wide awareness.

## Technologies Used

* Node.js for application development
* N8N for workflow automation and integration
* Google Sheets as a backend data store
* HTTP request modules for SMS, WhatsApp messaging, and CRM integration
* CRM system: Payamgostar
* Slack and Telegram for notifications

## Outcomes and Benefits

* Successfully launched in August 2025 and completed in November 2025.
* Streamlined and intelligent lead capture process that enhances client engagement.
* Improved data management and real-time notifications to accelerate administrative responses.
* Secure user verification mechanism increased reliability of lead contacts.
* Enabled effective team collaboration across multiple platforms (Slack, Telegram).

This comprehensive solution effectively connected a landing page to a full customer relationship management workflow, optimizing Rahkar Gasht’s immigration consultation and lead handling process.
